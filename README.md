# Introduction

Record management is the practice of destroying data-records that have met their
end-of-life time. "Zaakgericht werken" prescribes the archiving terms for cases
that have been brought to an end.

The Open-archiefbeheer (OAB) provides functionality for record
managers to schedule destruction of cases according to the archiving parameters.
It implements a multi-step, multi-role accordance process.

Attention is paid to the user experience of the staff using the app, with
notifications to inform you of pending work-load, full audit logging and
traceability of user and system actions.

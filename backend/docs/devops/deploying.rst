Deploying
=========

We currently have 2 ways to deploy:

#. With Ansible: 
   For deploying with Ansible, we use the ``maykinmedia/commonground-deployment`` repo.
#. With Kubernetes:
   For deploying with Kubernetes, we use the charts in the ``maykinmedia/charts`` repo and the values in the ``maykinmedia/kubernetes-deployment`` repo.

Please see the respective (private) repositories mentioned above for more information on deployment.
